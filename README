= Referals =

Referals is a simple sinatra application that 
enables you to track page visits on google
analytics through your server, not javascript

Technically, it listens for incoming connections,
send a request to google analytics with your
account code, then if a redirect url is found
in the configuration, redirects the client to it.

This code is based on garu, my port of the goole
analytics for mobile PHP script in a ruby gem

== INSTALLATION ==

Download, clone, copy/paste are all methods you
can use.

	git clone git@github.com:ekynoxe/referals.git
	cd refereals

== CONFIGURATION ==

Referal uses a yaml settings file to store your
google analytics account and redirect urls
corresponding to a path in the url. Check the
sample settings.yml file for an example

== RUNNING ==

* Make sure you've got sinatra and garu installed:

	gem install sinatra
	gem install garu (garu lives on github at https://github.com/ekynoxe/garu)

* Run!

	ruby referals.rb
